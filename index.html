      // GLSL's syntax is somewhat like C, but it has a few differences.

      // There are four different types of variables in GLSL: input, output, uniform, and internal.
      // - Input variables are sent from the buffer, in a way defined by GL.VertexAttribPointer.
      // - Output variables are sent from this shader to the next one in the chain (which will be the fragment shader most of the time).
      // - Uniforms will be touched on in the next tutorial.
      // - Internal variables are defined in the shader file and only used there.


      // The vertex shader is run once for every vertex. In C# pseudocode, it might look something like:
      // foreach(var vertex in vertices)
      //   shader(vertex)


      // This defines our input variable, aPosition.
      // It starts with the line "layout(location = 0)". This defines where this input variable will be located, which is needed for GL.VertexAttribPointer.
      // However, you can omit it, and replace this with just "in vec3 aPosition". If you do that, you'll have to replace the 0 in GL.VertexAttribPointer with
      //   a call to GL.GetAttribLocation(shaderHandle, attributeName)
      // Next, the keyword "in" defines this as an input variable. We'll have an example of the "out" keyword in the next tutorial.
      // Then, the keyword "vec3" means this is a vector with 3 floats inside.

      layout(location = 0) in vec3 aPosition;
      layout(location = 1) in vec4 aColour;
      layout(location = 2) in vec3 aNormal;

      out vec4 ourColour;

      uniform vec3 uLightPosition;
      uniform mat4 uModel;
      uniform mat4 uView;
      uniform mat4 uProjection;

      // Like C, we have an entrypoint function. In this case, it takes void and returns void, and must be named main.
      // You can do all sorts of calculations here to modify your vertices, but right now, we don't need to do any of that.
      // gl_Position is the final vertex position; pass a vec4 to it and you're done.
      // Keep in mind that we only pass a vec3 to this shader; the fourth component of a vertex is known as "w".
      // It's only used in some more advanced OpenGL functions; it's not needed here.
      // So with a call to the vec4 function, we just give it a constant value of 1.0.

      void main(void)
      {
          vec3 modelViewVertex = vec3(vec4(aPosition, 1.0) * uModel * uView);
          vec3 modelViewNormal = normalize(vec3(vec4(aNormal, 0.0) * uModel * uView));
          vec3 lightPos = vec3(vec4(uLightPosition, 0.0) * uView);
          vec3 lightDir = normalize(lightPos - modelViewVertex);
          float diffuse = max(dot(modelViewNormal, lightDir), 0.1);

          gl_Position = vec4(aPosition, 1.0) * uModel * uView * uProjection;
          ourColour = aColour * diffuse;
